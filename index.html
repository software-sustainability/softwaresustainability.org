          <h4>What is software sustainability?</h4>
          <p>
            Software sustainability is the the capacity of the software to
            endure. In other words, sustainability means that the software
            will continue to be available in the future, on new platforms,
            meeting new needs.<br/>

            This means it's easy to evolve and maintain,
            fulfils its intent over time,
            survives uncertainty,
            and addresses relevant concerns
            (Political, Economic, Social, Technical, Legal, Environmental).
          </p>
          <h4>What is a software sustainability initiative?</h4>
          <p>
            A software sustainability initiative is an organisation or team
            undertaking activities to improve software sustainability in the
            wider community (that is, outside of their local project or group).
            <br/>
            Those activities might include consultancy and development,
            training, workshops and events, dissemination and outreach, or
            advocacy.
            <br/>
            We are focussed on research software: specialist software which is
            used in research.
